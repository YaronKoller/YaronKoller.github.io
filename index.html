					<h1>Hi, I'm Yaron Koller.</h1>
					<p>
						I'm a second year computer science student at the <b>University of Waterloo.</b> I've had a passion for technology and problem solving ever since I can remember. When I took my first computer science course, I found that nothing quite compares to the thrill of seeing your code come to life, and I've been hard at work to become a software engineer ever since!

								A 2D role-playing game, made using the Unity game engine and coded in C#. The game is unique in that, rather than giving the user numbers and statistics, it gives written descriptions of health, damage, etc. I have been working on Blind as part of a team comprising of <a href="https://github.com/ggkevinxing">Kevin Xing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/shanpls">Shan Phylim</a>, and myself (with some additional help from <a href="https://github.com/adijp">Aditya Jayaprakash</a>). Blind is an ongoing project and has taught me a lot about teamwork and project management.

								My own personal take on The Legend of Zelda, a classic Nintendo video game. As with my other video game project, MyZelda was developed in Unity and coded in C#. This project marked my first time coding in C# as well as my first time using Git on command-line for version control. Despite being a little unpolished in its final form, MyZelda was a great learning experience, teaching me many skills that I have used in all of my subsequent projects.

								If you're reading this, you must have already gotten a glimpse of what this project is about! My personal website is a work in progress and is meant to showcase some of my projects, along with my resume and some contact information. It is currently written only in HTML and CSS (with some help from Bootstrap), and is my first real attempt at web development. I hope to add a lot more to this website in the future (such as interactive features, once I learn JavaScript).
